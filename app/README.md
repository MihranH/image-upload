# About the app

# App folder is the root of the project, it has backend specific folders like router, services, models, 
# controllers, it has also client folder, where we have all the front end logic. Actually it is better practice to have
# backend and frontend in separate folders but as we are hosting the project in heroku then there is need for some
# specific architecture. Also some secure contents like password is better to store in ENV file.
